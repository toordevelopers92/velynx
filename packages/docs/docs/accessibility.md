# Accessibility

Velynx aims for accessible defaults and clear patterns.

## Checklist

- Provide text alternatives for icons and avatars
- Ensure sufficient contrast for custom themes
- Use `aria-expanded` and `aria-hidden` on interactive panels
- Keep focus visible with `vxu-focus-ring`
- Provide keyboard triggers for dropdowns and dialogs

## Component notes

- Modals: include a close button inside the panel
- Tabs: mark tabs and panels with data attributes so the module applies roles
- Tooltips: use only for supplemental content; never hide critical information
