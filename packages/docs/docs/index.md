# Velynx

Velynx is a glassmorphism-first front-end framework with a utility layer, a component layer, and a small set of dependency-free interaction modules. It is designed for high-contrast, futuristic interfaces that stay fast and accessible.

## Philosophy

- Surfaces are translucent by default, with blur and glow governed by tokens.
- Utilities favor readable, semantic families with consistent grammar.
- Components are composable without forcing a single layout pattern.
- Motion is subtle, optional, and respectful of reduced-motion preferences.

## What you get

- Core CSS for layout, typography, and glass surfaces
- Extended CSS for the full component set and effects
- Tokens-only build for custom pipelines
- Vanilla TypeScript modules for common UI behaviors

## Kitchen sink

See `kitchen-sink` for a single-page gallery of utilities and components.
